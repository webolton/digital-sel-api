0.0, "c xxxıı" written in later hand in upper-left margin, "seínt botolf" written in a contemporary hand, centered, above text.
1.1, "C xlxıȷ" (???) written in left margin. Capital "S" descends three lines. Each couplet is connected by a swooping line in the left margin.
9.1, The pilcrows are set in the left margin.
58.11, The word "heþír" looks very much like "heþín."
51.0, The Arabic number 306 is written in the upper left margin in a later hand. In the margin, in the corner, another later hand has written, "Really 208 / for no 141 ..." This is very faint in the scan and barely legible.
60.8, "he myȝt segge as me seyþ ín game." I wonder what "game" the author is talking about here.
66.4, "monkís" seems be the spelling of the abreviation "᷒."
74.13, "Am̅e" is written in the right margin, and surrounded by a double bordered box. In the bottom left corner of the page, a later hand has written as an apparent pen trial "In this book ..." The phrase is not legible and has been crossed out. There is a watermark faintly visible in the middle of the page under the last line. It looks like it may be something like Briquet 2611 or 3944.
