Seınt Nıcholas þe holı mon · þᵗ god ꝯſeıler was
Comen was of heíȝe men · ın þe cíte of patras
In Patras ewas ıbore · ínul ow nouȝ líe
Hıs moder hatte ȷoane · ıs fader Epıhaníe .
Þe furſte daẏ þat he was bore · þe chıld þat was god
As he was ín a mele laþed · alone vprıȝt eſtod .
And as ſone as he was bore · he bıcom god and clene
Þe vrıdaẏ ne þe wedneſdaẏ · he nolde ſouke bote ene .
Þo ecouþe gon and ſpeke · he ne pleíȝede neu͛ mo
Ac whanne oþ͛ pleíȝden · to chírche ewoulde go ·
Non ıdel ſpeche he ne ſpek · as oþ͛ chıdren doþ
Líȝínge and pleíȝínge he ne louede · ı tellet ow forſoþ .
Þo he was of gret elde · to  ſcole he was ıſet
E leornede wel ınow · me nuſte no chıld bet .
Seþþe þat e couþe wít · as hís ſtudíe hím tok
To goſpeles and to holı churche · al oþ͛ þıng he forſok .
So clene lıf he ladde · þat íoıe ít was to wıten
More godneſſe ne míȝte beo · þa̅ me fond ı̅ hím ıwıtten .

Luttel tolde of al herᵉ gode · and herᵉ eír he was .
To pore men he ıt ȝaf · whar ſo he ſaıȝ neode
And whanne heo no̅ ne beden · ſtıllelıche he gan he bede ·
A rıche mon was bıſıde · þat ſedde þorw luþ͛ cas
Is god ȝeode al aweẏ · and al pore he was .
Þreo douȝtren he hadde · fod and clene alſo
In meſeıſe heo were̅ ıbroȝt · þ͛ heo nuſte̅ what to do .
Heore red heo nome̅ alle · ful wẏmme̅ to bı come
Þo heo nuſten how to lıbben · here god was al bınome .
