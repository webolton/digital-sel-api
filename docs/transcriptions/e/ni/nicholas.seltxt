Seınt Nıcholas þe holı mon · þᵗ god ꝯſeıler was
Comen was of heíȝe men · ın þe cíte of patras
In Patras ewas ıbore · ínul ow nouȝ líe
Hıs moder hatte ȷoane · ıs fader Epıhaníe .
Þe furſte daẏ þat he was bore · þe chıld þat was god
As he was ín a mele laþed · alone vprıȝt eſtod .
And as ſone as he was bore · he bıcom god and clene
Þe vrıdaẏ ne þe wedneſdaẏ · he nolde ſouke bote ene .
Þo ecouþe gon and ſpeke · he ne pleíȝede neu͛ mo
Ac whanne oþ͛ pleíȝden · to chírche ewoulde go ·
Non ıdel ſpeche he ne ſpek · as oþ͛ chıdren doþ
Líȝínge and pleíȝínge he ne louede · ı tellet ow forſoþ .
Þo he was of gret elde · to  ſcole he was ıſet
E leornede wel ınow · me nuſte no chıld bet .
Seþþe þat e couþe wít · as hís ſtudíe hím tok
To goſpeles and to holı churche · al oþ͛ þıng he forſok .
So clene lıf he ladde · þat íoıe ít was to wıten
More godneſſe ne míȝte beo · þa̅ me fond ı̅ hím ıwıtten .
A fore ís fader deþ and moder · þís gode mon Nıcholas
Luttel tolde of al herᵉ gode · and herᵉ eír he was .
To pore men he ıt ȝaf · whar ſo he ſaıȝ neode
And whanne heo no̅ ne beden · ſtıllelıche he gan he bede ·
A rıche mon was bıſıde · þat ſedde þorw luþ͛ cas
Is god ȝeode al aweẏ · and al pore he was .
Þreo douȝtren he hadde · fod and clene alſo
In meſeıſe heo were̅ ıbroȝt · þ͛ heo nuſte̅ what to do .
Heore red heo nome̅ alle · ful wẏmme̅ to bı come
Þo heo nuſten how to lıbben · here god was al bınome .
And raþe͛ þan he deıȝeden for honger · to lıbben ın horedom
Þe ſelı mon heore fader gret deol · to hım he nom .
Gret pıte hedde ın herte · þe godemon ſeín Nıcholas
Þo he herde of þe deol · þat among hem was .
Of ís fader god þat was · aweg of gold he nom
Into antıoche ſtıllelıche · to heore ouſe e com .
To aderne wındow · ſtillıche e con gon
And caſte ın þe gold p͛uelıche · and wende aȝeın anon .
A morwe þe mon aros · and þ͛ of nuſte nouȝt

Þ͛ of he was glad · he nuſte who ıt brouȝte
He þonkede ȝerne ıhu̅ crıſt · þat ın ıs meſeẏſe þouȝte .

And þonkede ȝerne god · þat hadde herd ıs loue .

Þat þıs mon hedde nede · þat me hım more brouȝte .
A nıȝt e lokede tıme · as ourᵉ lord ıt wolde
Ac anoþ͛ feneſtre he caſte · anoþ͛ beeȝ of golde .
Þe þe hoſbounde amorwe ros · & þe gold fond ſone
And þonkede god mıd gode herte · þᵗ hadde herd ís bone .
Ac naþelese he wondreded who ıs frend ſo were
And þouȝte he wold awaıten · ȝıf he more come þere .
E conſeıleıde ís oþ͛ douȝt͛ · wel mıd þe golde

A nıȝt he wende ſtıllıche · to þe feneſtre eft ſone
And caſte ın abeẏ of gold · as he dude er ılome .
Þe hoſbonde wakede ȝet · to awaıte̅ þís cas
So þat þe golde mon · al wakınde þo was .
Vp he ſturte anon · & ſıwede hım wel faſte
And lette hım nouȝt ar he was . knowe̅ ate laſte .

And alle were̅ god wíues · & ríche þorw ſeın Nıchlas .

Whanne þᵗ oþ͛e pleíȝeden · he nadde þ͛ to no wılle
Ac at chírche ın an hurne · hıs bedes he bad ſtılle .

So þat heo weren ın bedes · níȝt and day wel faſte
Þat god hem ſende a god mon · he hered hem ate laſte .

Goþ he ſeıde to morewe · to chírche er hıt daẏ beo
And þe furſte mon þat ȝe mowen · ín þe chırche íſeo .

And makeþ hím bıſchop of míre · vor god haþ herd ourᵉ bone .

Heo nome̅ and ladden hım forþ · to þe chírche of mírre
And ſacreden hím to bıſchop · & ſente̅ hím ın ſe þerre .
Þo he was bıſchop mad · þís holí mon Nıcholas

And ȝıf ít for eıȝe of god · hım were leuer wíþ oute .
So redí he was to alle · þat to hím ouȝt críde
And ſuch míracle vor hem dede · þat ſpak þ͛ of wíde .

In a ſchíp to don herᵉ nede · ȝıf god hem grace ſende .
So þat þ͛ com a gret tempeſt · þat heo wende to drenche
Heo bıheten god al þe godneſſe · þat heo míȝten on þenche ·
So heo þouȝten as herᵉ ſchıp · toward þe grounde was
Of þe godneſſe þat me ſpak · of þe bıſchop Nıcholas .

Ȝíf ít ís ſoþ þat me haþ · of þe ıtol ſo wíde .
