Seınt Nıcholas þe holı mon · þᵗ god ꝯſeıler was
Comen was of heíȝe men · ın þe cíte of patras
In Patras ewas ıbore · ínul ow nouȝ líe
Hıs moder hatte ȷoane · ıs fader Epıhaníe .
Þe furſte daẏ þat he was bore · þe chıld þat was god
As he was ín a mele laþed · alone vprıȝt eſtod .
And as ſone as he was bore · he bıcom god and clene
Þe vrıdaẏ ne þe wedneſdaẏ · he nolde ſouke bote ene .
Þo ecouþe gon and ſpeke · he ne pleíȝede neu͛ mo
Ac whanne oþ͛ pleíȝden · to chírche ewoulde go ·
Non ıdel ſpeche he ne ſpek · as oþ͛ chıdren doþ
